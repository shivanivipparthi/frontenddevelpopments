    <h2> Introduction to C++</h2>
    <article>
        <p>
            C++ is the most used and most popular programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup. 
            C++ is a high-level and object-oriented programming language. 
            This language allows developers to write clean and efficient code for large applications and software development, game development, and operating system programming. 
            It is an expansion of the C programming language to include Object Oriented Programming(OOPs) and is used to develop programs for computers. 
            This C++ Tutorial will cover all the basic to advanced topics of C++ like C++ basics, C++ functions, C++ classes, OOPs and STL concepts.

    <h2> Introduction to NodeJS</h2>
    <article>
        <p>
            Node JS is an open-source and cross-platform runtime environment built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser. 
            It provides an event-driven, non-blocking (asynchronous) I/O and cross-platform runtime environment for building highly scalable server-side applications using JavaScript. 
            Node JS Tutorial Most people are confused and understand it’s a framework or a programing language. We often use NodeJS for building back-end services like APIs, Web App, or Mobile App. 
            It’s utilized in production by large companies like Paypal, Uber, Netflix, Walmart, etc.

    <h2>Features of NodeJS</h2>
    <article>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Easy Scalability: Node JS is built upon Chrome V8’s engine powered by Google. It allows Node to provide a server-side runtime environment that compiles and executes JavaScript at lightning speeds.</li>
                <li>Fast Suite: As we have discussed that NodeJS is highly scalable and lightweight that’s why it’s a heavy favorite for microservice architectures. 
                    In a nutshell, microservice architectures mean breaking down the application into isolated and independent services.</li>
                <li>Data Streaming: NodeJS comes to the rescue since it’s good at handling such an I/O process which allows users to transcode media files simultaneously while they are being uploaded. 
                    It takes less time compared to other data processing methods for processing data.</li>

                    <h2 >PYTHON Control Statements</h2>
                     <article>
                     <p>
                       <br>What are the Control Statements in Python?</br>
                             In Python, Loops are used to iterate repeatedly over a block of code. In order to change the way a loop is executed from its usual behavior, control statements are used. Control statements are used to control the flow of the execution of the loop based on a condition. There are many types of control statements in Python and in this tutorial, we will discuss all of them.

Control Statements in Python
Break statement
Continue statement
Pass statement

Break statement

The break statement in Python is used to terminate or abandon the loop containing the statement and brings the control out of the loop. It is used with both the while and the for loops, especially with nested loops (loop within a loop) to quit the loop. It terminates the inner loop and control shifts to the statement in the outer loop.

Continue statement

When a program encounters a continue statement in Python, it skips the execution of the current iteration when the condition is met and lets the loop continue to move to the next iteration. It is used to continue running the program even after the program encounters a break during execution.

Pass statement
The pass statement is a null operator and is used when the programmer wants to do nothing when the condition is satisfied. This control statement in Python does not terminate or skip the execution, it simply passes to the next iteration.

A loop cannot be left empty otherwise the interpreter will throw an error and to avoid this, a programmer can use the pass statement.

                    <h2>Reason to learn javascript</h2>
                    <article>
                    <p>
                    JavaScript is used by many developers (65% of the total development community), and the number is increasing day by day.
                     JavaScript is one such programming language that has more than 1444231 libraries and increasing rapidly. 
                     It is preferred over any other programming language by most developers. Also, major tech companies like Microsoft,
                     Uber, Google, Netflix, and Meta use JavaScript in their projects.

                    <h3>Things that make javascript demanding</h3>
                    <p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>No need for compilers: Since JavaScript is an interpreted language, therefore it does not need any compiler for compilation.</li>
                    <li>Used both Client and Server Side: Earlier JavaScript was used to build client-side applications only, but with the evolution of its frameworks namely Node.js and Express.js, it is now widely used for building server-side applications too.</li>
                    <li>Helps to build a complete solution: As we saw, JavaScript is widely used in both client and server-side applications, therefore it helps us to build an end-to-end solution to a given problem.</li>
                    <li>Used everywhere: JavaScript is so loved because it can be used anywhere. It can be used to develop websites, games or mobile apps, etc.</li>
